WAMP Identifiers definition is available at:

WAMP needs to identify the following ephemeral entities each in the scope noted

- Sessions (global scope)
- Publications (global scope)
- Subscriptions (router scope)
- Registrations (router scope)
- Requests (session scope)

These are identified in WAMP using IDs that are integers between (inclusive) 0
and 2^53 (9007199254740992):

IDs in the global scope MUST be drawn randomly from a uniform distribution over
the complete range [0, 2^53]

IDs in the router scope can be chosen freely by the specific router
implementation

IDs in the session scope SHOULD be incremented by 1 beginning with 1 (for each
direction - Client-to-Router and Router-to-Client)
